# StepExample

Simple test project about clear architecture and swift, 
there are 2 values = start index and final. I collect info by 10 ( current offset, i can change it in easy way), 
show it on table view, and load rest pieces in infinity scroll, until i reach last value.
I tryed to handle all possible errors, also at first screen is possible to cancel query
